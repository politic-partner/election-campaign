# Appendix B: Campaign Research Questions

These are a series of questions designed to assist the campaign in understanding the particular situation of this campaign and develop a realistic strategy.
Not every question may apply to every type of campaign but by working through the entire series you may begin to think about things you may have overlooked.

Some questions you will know the answer to immediately and others will require some research.
In some cases, you may have to take an educated guess about the answer to a particular question.
You should do this only as a last resort.
It is important that you set and stick to a time limit for completing this research and answering these questions.
