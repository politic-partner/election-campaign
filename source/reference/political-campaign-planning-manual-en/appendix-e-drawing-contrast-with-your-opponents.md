# Appendix E: Drawing Contrast with Your Opponents

One of the most difficult problems facing candidates and political activists is the problem of creating a contrast with your opponents in the minds of the voters.
Party programs and messages tend to be bland and generic, and the voters never understand why one candidate or party is better than another is.
As a result, voters grow cynical and begin to view democratic elections as meaningless.

In designing your campaign message, you must give your target audience the sharpest possible contrast with your opponents.
If you don't, then your target audience has no reason to vote for you instead of your opponent.
In order to ensure that your message has this contrast, you should be able to word it in the following way:

"When you go to the polls on Election Day, I want you to keep one thing in mind.
The differences between my opponent and me could not be clearer.
You can vote for me, who stands for XXX, or you can vote for my opponents, who stand for YYY.
What our country and our region need are a lot more XXX, and a lot less YYY.
That's what this election is about, and that's what you are going to decide."

When searching for the "XXX" and "YYY", you may look at the following areas:

1. Values: How is what you stand for significantly different than what your opponents stand for?
2. Policies: What would you do as an elected leader that is significantly different from what your opponents would do?
3. Experience: How will the differences between your work and educational experience and your opponents' experience influence the way you would behave in office?
   Often, when values and policies are very similar, experience is the best way to draw contrast -- Which candidate is best able to deliver the promised policies or values?

For any particular trait under the above headings, you must craft your message in order to draw the most favorable contrast with your opponents.
Examples of how to do this include:
