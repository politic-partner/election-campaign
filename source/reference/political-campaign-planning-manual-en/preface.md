# Preface
In preparation for the 1995 Russian Duma elections, NDI political trainers Ken Payne, Kate Head, and Sheila O'Connell, along with Russian experts Aleksei Shustov and Oleg Nikishenkov, wrote the Strategic Election Planning Manual.
This manual has been one of the most popular publications in the National Democratic Institute - Moscow office library and used by countless campaigns over the years.

Alex Grigorievs and I revised and updated the original manual at the beginning of 1998 and realized at that time that in preparation for the upcoming State Duma elections we would want to do a more complete revision.
This third edition is now called the Political Campaign Planning Manual, a Step by Step Guide to Winning Elections.

As with past editions, this manual combines the ideas and materials that NDI trainers and consultants have used in Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union since 1992.
I have kept the format of the past manuals and referred to them for guidance in putting this manual together.
I have expanded the areas that I thought needed more explanation and have added a number of worksheets to aid in the planning process.
Finally, I have tried to make the manual country and time neutral by removing most of the references to particular elections and particular countries.
What you will find here are the basic principles that can be applied to almost any campaign and any election.

This revision would not have been possible without the assistance of many others.
Most important to me has been the support and encouragement Janelle Cousino has provided these past two years in Moscow.
I could not have asked for a better partner.
Thanks must also go to the current NDI - Moscow training staff Alex Grigorievs, Raymond Sontag, Dima Valentey, Ali Aliev, and Vitaly Charushin for their input and assistance in both my training and contributing to this document.

Finally, all of us on the training staff know that our fabulous support staff of Olga Bereslavskaya, Andrey Musin, Rinat Saberov, and Lena Zybina is what makes everything we do possible.

Of course, I am fully responsible for any mistakes or unclear points in this manual.
At the very end, I have added an evaluation form so that you can let the NDI - Moscow office know what worked and what did not.
Your response and input will help make future versions of this manual more useful for everyone.
